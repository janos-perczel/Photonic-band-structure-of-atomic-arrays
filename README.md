# Photonic-band-structure-of-atomic-arrays

This MatLab code allows you to efficiently calculate the photonic band structure of any 2D atomic array for arbitrary
Bravais and non-Bravais geometries. See https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.96.063801 for more
details for the theory behind the calculations.
